Description: List of lessons learnt throughout my time at my first job.

## Orkney

### General

- Minimal focus on preparation
  - Constant focus on firefighting
  - Or completing tasks deemed required

- "Expert" opinions should never be simply accepted, always questioned. NEVER ACCEPT STATED EXPERIENCE AS VALIDATION.
- Experiments should be result and action based, the impacted of the gained insights should be considered before executing any tests.


- Experiments need to have appropriate structure to ensure impact:
  - Understand the environment and setup
  - The data points being tested
  - The dependant parameters
  - The expected change with those parameters based on given assumptions

- Ineffective planning:
  - Unrealistic timelines, unless urgent always refer to your task list and to determine a timeline - OVERESTIMATE
  - Each task should have intended effective results before being deemed complete
  - Feedback loops on estimates and task impact is crucial

- Importance of building interpersonal relationships with relevant useful parties:
  - Time spent building that personal relationship will always be fruitful in trust, effort and engagement.

- Presentations are about audience engagement, keeping them captivated and effectively portraying a message
  - Practice delivery of the presentation is key

### Technical

- No clear reasoning of the tools (language) choice made, should be deduced objectively not based on current skill sets only.
- No thought on code cleanliness and architecture
- Non standard code folder structure
- No design pattern usage
- Lack of explainer accompanying document/ comments dont replace poor code
- No clear consideration of PDU requirements to analyze potential options. 
- Unrealistic approach for effective decision making, important to always explore the implicit assumptions being made.
- Explore details in requirements and create simple comparison tables ie cost, certification, power output etc.
- Make decisions with stated assumptions and keep moving.
- Use effective tools for data collection and analysis, to vastly improve efficiency
