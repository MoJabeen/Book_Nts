# Lessons from the lake

Description: List of lessons learnt throughout my time at my first job.

## Orkney

- Minimal focus on preparation
  - Constant focus on firefighting
  - Or completing tasks deemed required

- "Expert" opinions should never be simply accepted, always questioned. NEVER ACCEPT STATED EXPERIENCE AS VALIDATION.
- Experiments should be result and action based, the impacted of the gained insights should be considered before executing any tests.
- Experiments need to have appropriate structure to ensure impact:
  - Understand the environment and setup
  - The data points being tested
  - The dependant parameters
  - The expected change with those parameters based on given assumptions
