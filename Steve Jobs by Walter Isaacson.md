Description: Overview and thoughts on the book "Steve Jobs by Water Issacson".

# Steve Jobs by Walter Issacson

## Apple I 

The innovation was the connection between the keyboard and monitor.
~ Generally not immediatley obvious the benefit and saught after in sales.

- Jobs understood the requirments to sell a product 
  - Robust supply chain 
  - Exceptional marketing
  - Strong margin
  - Innovative product

## Apple II

Complete unit with integrated complete package including monitor, keyboard and cassete tape (extended to floppy disk)

- Major feature: The 8 expandable ports that allowed others to develop and add thier own additions to the device.
    - ~ This key product feature to the success of the apple II created an open system for others to work on:
      - Pros: Any other devices developed by others for the apple II allowed you to up sale the device. Entices hobbyists and enthusiasts to develop on your device.
      - Cons: Device was taken as something to be developed on and not the complete product. No longer complete control over the users experience, can be ruined by other devices. Doesn't up-sell any other products in the closed system.

This was a key difference between Jobs and Woz, Gates etc approach to products. Jobs wanted a closed system with full control over all elements of the product even after sale. 

### What was the marketing philosophy used by apple?

### Why was Woz unable to create a successful company ?

Woz wanted to completely focus on the engineering elements, and enjoy all elements of the workspace. Almost create a playground.

Jobs wanted a ruthless effective business.

## The MAC 

It was a difficult pressured environment, all the engineers were asked to work extremely hard but loved every moment. They knew they were creating something incredible.
~ This is what allows companies and products to be exceptional, to captivate the work force to go the extra mile to push the extra distance.

Jobs liked to impose the idea of being pirates, rebels and extraordinary

## Why did John Sculley fail?

- Non transferrable skills (His experience did not translate to this new role)
- Was focussed on impressing Jobs therefore couldn't stand up to him when required to
- Didn't understand the product
- Was unable to bring focus and direction in the company

John was supposedly an expert in marketing, however Jobs has some intriguing views on marketing:

>> "Did Alexander graham bell do any market research before he invented the telephone?"

## What made the 1984 advert special?

The 1984 advert showed the escape from a monopoly on the personal computer from created by IBM.

- This captivated an audience about the vision of a product
