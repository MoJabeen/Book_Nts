Description: Overview and thoughts on the book "Steve Jobs by Water Issacson".

# Steve Jobs by Walter Issacson

## Apple I 

The innovation was the connection between the keyboard and monitor.
~ Generally not immediately obvious to the market this benefit, required active strong sales effort to convince distributors to purchase.

- Jobs understood the requirements to sell a product 
  - Robust supply chain 
  - Exceptional marketing
  - Strong margin
  - Innovative product

## Apple II

Complete unit with integrated package including monitor, keyboard and cassette tape (extended to floppy disk)

- Major feature: The 8 expandable ports that allowed others to develop and add their own additions to the device.
    - ~ This key product feature was vital to the success of the apple II, creating an open system for others to work on:
      - Pros: Any other devices developed by others for the apple II allowed you to up sale the device. Entices hobbyists and enthusiasts to develop on your device.
      - Cons: Device was taken as something to be developed on and not the complete product. No longer complete control over the users experience, can be ruined by other devices. Doesn't up-sell any other products in the closed system.

This was a key difference between Jobs and Woz, Gates etc approach to products. Jobs wanted a closed system with full control over all elements of the product even after sale. 

### What was the marketing philosophy used by apple?

- Empathy - Connect with your customers and understand their feelings towards their issues
- Focus - Only focus on the important issues
- Impute *People do judge a book by its cover* all aspects make a difference

### Why was Woz unable to create a successful company ?

Woz wanted to completely focus on the engineering elements, and enjoy all elements of the workspace; create a playground.

Jobs wanted a ruthless effective business.

## The MAC 

It was a difficult pressured environment, all the engineers were asked to work extremely hard but loved every moment. They knew they were creating something incredible.

~ This is what allows companies and products to be exceptional, to captivate the work force to go the extra mile to push the extra distance.

Jobs liked to impose the idea of being pirates, rebels and extraordinary.

- Team retreats allowed for moments of effective bonding and deeper connection the company.
- The MAC would never have been built from focus groups and committees.

- Jobs unnecessary desire for perfectionism at the factory was detrimental to operational efficiency and output. (Desire was to inspire effective teamwork and collaboration through perfectly kept factories ~ the priorities on what a factory should focus on to be effective was off)
- The main issue with the MAC was the limitations created on the product chasing the ideal computer form Jobs envisioned (ie no fans as it would hinder the calm image he desired, caused overheating components).
  - Lack of balance in the practicality of using the device.

## Why did John Sculley fail?

- Non transferrable skills (His experience did not translate to this new role).
- Was focussed on impressing Jobs therefore couldn't stand up to him when required to.
- Didn't understand the product, with no appetite to learn the product and the what they are trying to achieve.
- Was unable to bring focus and direction in the company.

John was supposedly an expert in marketing, however Jobs had some intriguing views on marketing:

> "Did Alexander graham bell do any market research before he invented the telephone?"

## What made the 1984 advert special?

The 1984 advert showed the escape from a monopoly on the personal computer created by IBM.

- This captivated an audience about the vision of a product, not only the actual product and its features.
- Created fans from existing communities of rebels and anti-authority, connecting them to the brand and product.
- **Fans and not just consumers is monumental in creating an effective brand.**

## What were the lessons from NeXT ?

- Failed as a product that could fit into the market.
- No one was able to balance Jobs insane demands of the company, operations and product decisions.
- Showed jobs side of ruthless business, in terms of managing operational costs.

## What made Pixar successful?

- Jobs was able to find exceptional people in John Lasseter and enabled them with great technology and strategic partnerships.
- Ensured the business had the appropriate connections, deals and effective marketing of the achievements.

## Why was Jobs return to Apple a success ?

- He was immediately aware big decisions have to be made to FAST for the company to succeed.
> "Lasting companies know how to reinvent themselves"
- Understood the need for strategic partnerships, for example with microsoft.
- Reinvented the apple brand, using ads such as think different.

- Jobs hated the use of powerpoint and insisted they are not used during product meetings:
  - ~ Powerpoint is an effective way to present information for the audience to digest.
  - ~ However, not great for engagement a one sided information flow - does not incentivize collaboration.

- Focus is key, singular focus on any products and the number of tasks in the company. ~ Achieve greatness doing few things than be mediocre achieving many.

## Why did Jony Ive have the impact he did ?

- He understood all elements of the business including the product.
- He approached design, similar to all designers a breakdown of philosophy leading to decisions.

## iMac

- This was Jobs without the majority of the idealistic flaws that lead to the issues in the Mac.
- He relied on his exceptional team to achieve great things.
- With same old focus of creating a great product, great marketing with a great brand.

## Tim Cook

- Massive impact on the companies operational effectiveness.
- Reduced key suppliers, cut better deals, enforced relocation, closed warehouses.

## iPod/iPhone

- Understood the general state of the market is one full of crap products.
- Founded on making great UX and beautiful products.
- Jobs was able to cultivate a group of exceptional people to **live** the product they were creating. Leading to great ideas and execution.

## Closed loop systems

Jobs early vision was to create a closed system, end to end control. This played to fruition in the birth of iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, iPad etc

- Enabled improved experience, where all elements are integrated.
- In built marketing of each product to other products.
- Enabled the brand to remain pure with a clear concept.

## Legacy

- Be the force that ensures only top talent is prevalent, allow all departments to gauge if they fit well into the company.
- Directness in approach in criticism and praise is the most effective method of communication to ensure the message is clearly communicated.
- Concurrent engineering, in which all departments are working together for an effective outcome.

- Focus on making great products not only profits.
